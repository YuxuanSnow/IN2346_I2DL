    "# Data Augmentation\n",
    "  \n",
    "In this notebook we will show different data augmentation techniques on **CIFAR-10 dataset** using pytorch. As you already learned in class, data augmentation is not only a solution when you don't have enough data to train, but also an effective way to improve the generalization performance of your classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Image Augmentation is the process of generating new images for training our deep learning model. These new images are generated using the **existing training images** and hence we don’t have to collect them manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "**HOWEVER**, these techniques do not come entirely for free. You need to consider the 'safety' of your augmentation. The safety of a Data Augmentation method refers to its likelihood of preserving the label post-transformation. For example, rotations and flips are generally safe on ImageNet challenges such as cat versus dog, but not safe for digit recognition tasks such as 6 versus 9. Besides, some augmentation techniques will increase the computation expensiveness and lead to additional training time. So you need to have this in mind before you apply data augmentation to your dataset."

    "## When to apply Image Augmentation?\n",

    "Image data augmentation can be applied as a pre-processing step before we train the model or can be applied in real time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Offline Augmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Augmentation is applied as a pre-processing step to increase the size of the dataset. This is usually done when we have a small training dataset that we want to expand. Generating augmentation on smaller dataset is helpful but we need to consider the disk space when applying on larger datasets. In this case, the size of the augmented dataset is fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Online Augmentation\n",
    "As the name suggests, this kind of augmentation is applied in real time. This is usually applied for larger datasets as we do not need to save the augmented images on the disk. In this case, we apply transformations in mini-batches and then feed it to the model. So the size of the augmented dataset that the model actually sees can be infinitly large.\n",
    "\n",
    "In online augmentation, the model will see different images at each epoch. In offline augmentation, the augmented images are part of the training set, so it views the augmented image multiple times depending on the number of epochs. Hence, the model could generalize better with online augmentation as it sees more samples during training with online data augmentation."
