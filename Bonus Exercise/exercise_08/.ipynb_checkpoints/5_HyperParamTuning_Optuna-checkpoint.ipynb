    "Optuna is an automatic hyperparameter optimization framework, which works with several deep learning libraries, including PyTorch Lightning. Have a look at https://github.com/optuna/optuna!\n",
    "\n",
    "Two important concepts of Optuna are the terms **Study** and **Trial**:\n",
    "* **Study**: optimization based on an objective function (e.g.: maximize validation accuracy)\n",
    "* **Trial**: a single execution of the objective function (i.e., train a model for a specific hyperparameter configuration)\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of a study is to find out the optimal set of hyperparameter values through multiple trials (e.g., n_trials=100). Optuna is a framework designed for the automation and the acceleration of the optimization studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "On a high level, hyper parameter tuning with Optuna works very similar to the search algorithms we implemented in exercise 6. However, Optuna has a set of advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Parallelization** of hyperparameter searches over multiple threads or processes without modifying code\n",
    "* more **efficient search algorithms** for large search spaces and **pruning of unpromising trials** for faster results\n",
